## PROJECT_DENGUE EXERCISE.

The following code was used to **create the project directory**

`mkdir -p project_dengue{Data/{Raw,processed},codes}`

There are two ways to link your directory  to github

 #### Cloning using the following code

 Here you first need to create your github repository and clone it on your local terminal using the url

`git clone: url`

#### Initialising your directory as a repository
If you already have the directory in your local terminal like me and want to link it to a repository on your github. Just initialize!! üòÉ

Follow these steps to do that 

```
 cd path/to/project_dengue

git init 

git remote add origin place/the/url/here

git remote -v

```

Now you can comfortably **push** file from your terminal to github

To get the **number of files in the zipped file**. Run the following code:

`unzip -l dengue.zip | grep -c "^[ ]*[0-9]" `

The first part of the code is meant to list the contents of the zipped file including the sizes, date and time 

The second part of the code is meant to search for patterns, here we are looking for lines that begin with a space and followed by integers and counting this lines üëç

Another code that can be used here is 

`unzip -Z1 yourfile.zip | wc -l`

Here we are listing the file names without details like size and date of the zipped file and counting each line of the output.

To **get the number of lines in each file** do the following
